# Autonomous Navigation Drone (ANAV): Safe Landing Detection 
This project was part of the ISRO IRoC-U 2025 challenge, where we built a drone that can fly and land on its own—without any external GPS or signals, just like it would on Mars. The goal was to make the drone smart enough to find a safe place to land, even in tricky conditions.

### My contributions :-

   - Wrote the computer vision code using Python and OpenCV to let the drone see and decide where it’s safe to land.

   - Developed a system that could detect both safe and unsafe landing spots and give their exact positions for the drone to use.

   - Helped combine the vision system with the drone’s controls, so it could land smoothly and safely on its own.

 ### Tools & Technologies Used :-
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Basic image processing algorithms** for safe/unsafe area detection

 ###  Key Highlights :-
- Developed a **real-time vision system** that could detect obstacles and hazards while in flight.
- Provided **precise coordinates** of potential landing spots to the drone's navigation system.
- Achieved **94% detection accuracy**, enhancing the drone’s **autonomy and safety**, a critical requirement for planetary exploration missions like those on **Mars**.
